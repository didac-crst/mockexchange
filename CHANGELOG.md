# Changelog

All notable changes to MockExchange will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project uses tags (`vX.Y.Z`) as releases.

Releases are created by pushing a Git tag (vX.Y.Z) or using GitHub's 'Draft a new release' UI. CI runs on tags to validate the release.
